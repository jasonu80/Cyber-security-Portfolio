## Challenges Faced

There are several challenges that I face in this room, especially in understanding layers of the OSI model. Here are what I faced:

**1. Misconception on the actual function of layer 6 in the OSI Layer.**

Based on what I have read on the concept given by TryHackMe, I was thinking the function of this layer is primarily lies on the security feature, which is the encryption. After receiving the mistake, I changed the answer to the correct ones, which is `translation`. It functions primarily to translate data to and from the Application layer located at layer 7.

**2. OSI Lab game**

This game challenges me to memorise the OSI Layer starting from the Physical layer up to the Application layer. I managed to solve it within 26 seconds as I have learned about OSI Model 2 to 3 years ago in a cyber security competition.

## Conclusion

I found that this room is a foundational level for beginners who wants to enter into cyber security. Networking is one of the crucial components in Cyber Security as it helps a threat actor on how data is transmitted between 2 different devices.
